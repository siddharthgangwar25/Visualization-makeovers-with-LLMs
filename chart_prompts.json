  "Line Plot": "RULES: \nLine Plot Issues: \n- Improper scale or axis limits: Distorted scaling can exaggerate or downplay trends.\n- Too many lines: Overcrowding the plot with too many lines can make it difficult to distinguish between them.\n- Non-zero baselines: Starting the y-axis at any value other than zero can mislead viewers about the trend’s magnitude.\n- Overuse of gridlines: Excessive gridlines can clutter the plot and distract from the data.\n- Uneven time intervals: Using inconsistent intervals on the x-axis (e.g., unequal time gaps) can cause misleading interpretations.\n- Confusing line styles: Overusing similar line styles makes it harder to differentiate the trends.\n- Dual Axis Chart Issue: Arbitrary scales on dual-axis charts can mislead readers by exaggerating or downplaying the relationship between the two data series.

  "Pie Chart": "RULES: \nPie Chart Issues: \n- Too many slices: More than 5-7 slices can make the chart cluttered and difficult to interpret.\n- Similar colors: Using colors that are too similar makes it hard to distinguish between slices.\n- Non-zero starting point: Starting the angle from anywhere other than the top (0 degrees) can distort the chart's appearance.\n- Using pie charts for non-percent data: Pie charts should only be used for parts of a whole; using them for non-percentage data is misleading.\n- Unequal slice sizes: Inaccurately scaled slices can mislead viewers about the relative proportions.\n- No labels or legends: Without proper labels, it’s unclear what each slice represents.\n- Exploding slices: Using the \"explode\" effect on slices to highlight them can create unnecessary emphasis and confusion.\n\nSuggest appropriate fixes for the detected issues at last.

  "Scatter Plot": "RULES: \nScatter Plot Issues: \n- Overlapping points: When data points overlap, it’s difficult to discern the true distribution.\n- Overuse of gridlines: Excessive gridlines can clutter the plot and distract from the data.\n- Non-zero baselines: Starting the y-axis at any value other than zero can mislead viewers about the trend’s magnitude.\n- Misleading axis scaling: Nonlinear or inappropriate scaling can distort the relationship between variables.\n- Lack of labels/legends: Without proper labels or legends, the plot can become confusing.\n- Using too many colors/markers: Introducing too many variations of color or markers makes the plot look chaotic and hard to interpret.\n- Not highlighting outliers: Failing to highlight outliers can overlook important insights about data distribution.\n- Ignoring data density: Sparse vs. dense areas might need better highlighting or aggregation.\n- Out of context trend lines: Adding trend lines without proper context can give a false impression of the data.\n- Dual Axis Chart Issue: Arbitrary scales on dual-axis charts can mislead readers by exaggerating or downplaying the relationship between the two data series.

  "Histogram": "RULES: \nHistogram Issues: \n- Inconsistent bin width: Using uneven bin widths can distort the perceived distribution of data.\n- Too many or too few bins: Too many bins lead to clutter, while too few obscure data patterns.\n- Non-zero baselines: Starting the y-axis at any value other than zero can mislead viewers about the trend’s magnitude.\n- Overuse of gridlines: Excessive gridlines can clutter the plot and distract from the data.\n- No zero baseline: Omitting zero from the y-axis distorts the viewer's understanding of the distribution.\n- Overlapping bins: When bins overlap, it becomes difficult to interpret the data.\n- Ignoring bin placement: Misaligned or non-standard bin placements can cause visual inaccuracies.\n- Failure to normalize: Not normalizing the histogram when comparing distributions can result in misleading insights.\n- Improper axis scaling: Poor scaling of the axes can misrepresent the spread or shape of the distribution.\n\nSuggest appropriate fixes for the detected issues at last.

  "Heatmap": "RULES: \nHeatmap Issues: \n- Confusing color scheme: Using colors that are hard to differentiate (e.g., red-green colorblind palette) can make the heatmap difficult to interpret.\n- No legend: A heatmap without a legend or scale makes it unclear what the colors represent.\n- Too many variables: Overcrowding a heatmap with too many variables makes it difficult to extract meaningful patterns.\n- Over-saturation of colors: Using too many distinct colors can make it harder to see subtle patterns.\n- No data normalization: Failing to normalize the data can result in visual distortion of trends.\n- Improper aspect ratio: A heatmap with an improper aspect ratio (too stretched or compressed) can make patterns harder to read.\n- No data labels: Missing data values within the cells of the heatmap can make it harder for viewers to get precise insights.\n\nSuggest appropriate fixes for the detected issues at last.
